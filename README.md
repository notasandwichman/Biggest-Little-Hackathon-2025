#### This is my submission for the Biggest Little Hackathon 2025 at UNR for the App Category

This application is intended to provide broke college students (like myself) with an easier way of seeing how to get the most food for their dollar.

There are certainly options in many places to get food for free such as Food Banks, the Food Pantry at UNR, and more. However, many students are unaware of these resources, don't feel they need them, or just want to eat out and treat themselves, and being a very broke college student myself it is difficult to choose where to eat.
This app is meant to address that and provide students with an easy to use interface to find the most amount of food for the lowest cost.
This is just a prototype and meant to show proof of concept. The goal would be to provide the ability to view all forms of nutritional value and sort by what you are looking to maximize, pull directly from various sources into the database using backend logic, and provide navigation options to tell students (especially new students) how to find these places.
I also want to be able to provide the ability to see Meal Trade nutritional value at a glance. 
This is necessary because there are very few accurate sources for this kind of info, and nothing that provides an at a glance view of how much value you are getting for your dollar.
Even our own Dine on Campus page is full of holes, inaccurate information, little to no nutrition information, and nothing about prices. Even the meal trades are different from page to page.
Without walking all around UNR, no student could find this kind of information easily, and they would have to do all these calculations manually.
